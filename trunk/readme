you cannot slap more restrictive licences on this or derived works.

I would like to know it, when you use this software. Please do send me
an e-mail or picture postcard, telling me who you are and what you're 
using Oriya-TeX for. It will encourage me to continue improving this 
software.

Warning

This is a work in progress, everything can change, and many letters
will go through several iterations of trial and improvement. Especially,
the assignments of glyphs to certain code positions is likely to change.

The files were prepared on a Macintosh, so you might have to convert
some text files to DOS or Unix end-of-line conventions.

It is intended the package will accept Unicode, ISCII and modified
Velthuis encoding, but as the pre-processor is not yet completed,
Oriya still has to be typed in a cumbersome graphical way.

Getting started

1. place the .tfm files where TeX and your DVI driver can find them.
2. place the .mf files in a place where Metafont can find them. Take care
   that your TeX installation is configured to automatically generate missing 
   fonts.

Now view or print the file orman.dvi for further instructions.
